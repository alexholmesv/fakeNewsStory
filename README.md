# Your Fake News Story

This is a simple vanilla JS app that provides a framework for a "Choose your own adventure" game, used as an interactive intervention to train critical thought and fact-checking skills.

All dialogue is hardcoded, so the app is very lightweight, and editing the story is as simple as changing the text, subtext and option elements in the game.js file.
